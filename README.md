# 🧠 AI in Credit Risk Modeling
**Unibo Fintech Society – AI/Tech Area Project**

This project explores how artificial intelligence can enhance **credit risk modeling**, comparing traditional statistical approaches and modern machine learning architectures in predicting loan default probabilities.

---

## 📍 Overview
Credit risk assessment is a central task in finance — determining the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.  
In this project, we experiment with various models ranging from **Logistic Regression** to **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and optional **TabTransformer** architectures, using the [German Credit Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).

The analysis focuses on:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training and performance evaluation  
- Explainability and interpretability through **SHAP values**  
- Comparison between accuracy and transparency in AI models

## 🧩 Objectives
- Build and compare machine learning models for credit default prediction  
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as Accuracy and ROC-AUC  
- Apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model decisions  
- Discuss ethical and regulatory implications of AI in credit scoring
